# Space Ship Temperature Monitor

This is a simple .NET Core console application written in C# that simulates a space ship temperature monitoring system.

It was created as an exercise to practice C# concepts like:

- Variables
- Data types
- Console input/output
- Conditional statements (if/else)
- Comparison operators

## Usage

To run the app, execute the following command: dotnet run


It will prompt you to enter the current temperature inside the spaceship. Depending on the value entered, it will show warning messages if temperature is too high or too low.

You can also input the current speed to check if it's within safe parameters.
